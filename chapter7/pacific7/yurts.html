        <h3><strong>What is a Yurt?</strong></h3>
          <p>Our luxury yurts are permanent four feet off the ground.

      <section><h3><strong>How are the yurts furnished?</strong></h3>
          <p>Each yurt is furnished with a gas fireplace, king-size bed with down quilt, comfy couch, dining table and chairs, mini-fridge, microwave, and coffee maker. Your luxury camping experience includes a sink with hot and cold running water. 
            Shower and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.</p></section>
      <section><h3><strong>What should I bring?</strong></h3>
          <p>Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing weather with light layers of clothing. 
            It's also helpful to bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!</p>
